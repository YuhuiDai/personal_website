unit test notes:

Steps to test locally:

1. If you have not download chromedriver, you need that to facilitate test-run.

2. change the setUp(self) function. Specifically:
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome("/Users/YOUR_DIRECTORY_TO_CHROMEDRIVER")
      
3. Open your simple local host via python, and add the url to:
		self.driver.get(URL)

4. run the test :)
